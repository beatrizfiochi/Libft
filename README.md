# 📚 Libft

This is my first project as a 42 student.  
Here I created my first library, recreating my own functions of the C standard library.  
Includes a `Makefile` for easy compilation.

## 🧠 About the Project

The goal of this project is to code a C library from scratch, replicating standard functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, `memset`, and more, using only allowed C functions. It serves as a foundation for many future 42 projects.
